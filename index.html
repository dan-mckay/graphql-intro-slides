    <h1>What is it?</h1>
    <br />
    <h2>Graph Query Language</h2>
    <br />
    <br />
    <ul>
      <li>A mechanism for moving data between server and client</li>
      <li>Allows a client to query exactly what data it requires</li>
      <li>Get data using queries</li>
      <li>Write data using mutations</li>
      <li>Subscribe to a real-time data feed using subscriptions</li>
    </ul>

    <!--
      1, Also a runtime for fulfilling
      these queries with existing data

      2, As opposed to REST endpoints for example, where we all the data that the API 
      is configured to send, whether required or not
    -->

    <h1>Background</h1>
    <br />
    <p>Facebook <i>"needed a data-fetching API powerful enough to describe all of Facebook, 
      yet simple enough to be easy to learn and use by our product developers."</i></p>
    <br />
    <p>Instead of multiple “dumb” endpoints, have a single “smart” endpoint that can send 
      the data in whichever shape the client requires</p>
    <!--
      Started at Facebook in 2012
      Open source release in 2015
      Are they saying product developers are simple? hmmm

      <h1>Features</h1>
      <br />
      <br />
      <ol>
        <li>Defines a data shape using schema</li>
        <li>Hierarchical structure</li>
        <li>Strongly Typed</li>
        <li>Plugs into your exisiting data</li>
        <li>Powerful developer tools</li>
      </ol>
      <!--
        1. Schema defines queries which mirror responses
        2. Such as nested objects in JSON
        3. Each level of a GraphQL query corresponds to a particular type, made up of fields of data such as string or int
        4. Not about storage, but more of a protocol to use your existing storage/ data model
        5. Such as graphiql
      -->

    <section>
      <h1>Schema</h1>
        <br />
        <code class="bash">
        type Address {
          street: String
          city: String
        }
        
        type User {
          id: UUID
          name: String
          address: Address
        }
        
        type Query {
          user: User
        }

        schema {
          query: Query
        } 
        </code>
      
        <!--
          - Scema defines the shape of your data using types and data fields
          - Every GraphQL API conforms to a schema
          - We are querying for a User, which is made up of id, name and address fields
          - Address is a type of its own made up city and street fields
        -->

    <h1>Query</h1>
    <br />
    <img src="./img/graphql.gif">

    <!--
      - Queries are used for reads
      - On the left we have the query syntax, showing how the client
      calls for the data. Sent as a HTTP POST request. See also we
      are passing in the user's id, telling the server which user
      we are interested in
      - On the right we have the server's response in JSON - N.B.
      the query isn't using JSON, but it is very similar
      - Graphql queries mirror the response
      - If you only want name ask for just the name etc.

      <h1>Mutation</h1>
      <code class="bash">
        mutation($userId: UUID!, $street: String, $city: String) {
          insertAddress(
            userId: $userId
            street: $street
            city: $city
          ) {
            street
            city
          }
        }
      </code>
      <code class="bash">
      // returns
      {
        "data": {
          "insertAddress": {
            "street": "Pearse Street",
            "city": "Dublin"
          }
        }
      }
      </code>
  
      <!--
        - Mutations are used for writes
        - In this simple exmple you can see that the mutation also returns data
        - This is useful when mutating existing data, for example, when incrementing a number field, 
          since we can mutate the value and query the new value of the field with a single request.
        - worth mentioning: Subscriptions - a way to push data from the server to the clients 
          that choose to listen to real time data feeds from the server - e.g. users online
          you could have a table in the db that you add a user id to when a user logs in and
          a client could subscribe to changes in that
